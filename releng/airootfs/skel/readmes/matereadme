MATE is installed with speach enabled by default.
In addition we enable autologin to prevent screen reader accesibility issues.

Some Keybind Information:

Orca has a special modifier key that works like SHIFT plus CONTROL plus ALT

Which key the "Orca Modifier" is bound to will, by default, depend on whether you are using Orca's Laptop keyboard layout or its Desktop keyboard layout:

    If you are using the Laptop layout, the default Orca Modifier will be CapsLock
    
    If you are using the Desktop layout, the Orca Modifier will be both Insert and KP_Insert also the same as KP_0
